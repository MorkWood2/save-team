It is a lottery system that serves students that truly\n          need a place to belong in our district! Whether students are coming\n          from trauma, failing out of school, or feeling the immense mental\n          pressures of large high school life, they are able to grow and find a\n          home in Team. Within a few months, we see shifts in intrinsic\n          motivation, feelings of belonging, and growth mindsets towards\n          education. <b>Team is a family and it does change lives.</b>{' '}\n        </p>\n        <div className='img-container'>\n          <img\n            className='img1'\n            src={Image}\n            alt='students backing in wilderness looking out at beach'\n          />\n          <span className='img-info'>\n            Team 06-07 looking out at the beautiful landscape of the Lost Coast,\n            California.\n          </span>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Due to the parcel tax not passing in this past election, cuts need to\n          be made in our district. Team is on the list this Tuesday night of\n          programs to be “suspended” for next school year. We know we cannot\n          come back from a suspension, so this will end the program. We need to\n          have our district understand what team really is and why this\n          transformative education program needs to stay! We fundraise for\n          everything and we are committed to helping the mental health and\n          growth of teens in our community. Before cutting our program, we hope\n          others can see it and feel the benefits that this program has on all\n          our lives.
